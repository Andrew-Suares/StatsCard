## Overview

This was a pretty easy challenge it took me about 4 hrs to complete. I am still rusty on responsive CSS so that took some extra work.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

## My process

I studied the design to think about planning my approach for each section ahead of time. Then I did the HTML markup. After that I completed the CSS styles. Last I completed the mobile media queries.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Media Queries
- Figma

### What I learned

The main thing I learned was how to use media queries more efficiently.

### Continued development

I want to learn more about responsive design and how to better use Flexbox and Grid.
